# cs336proj
A travel website for my Databases class

We didn't have time for certain features:
- connecting flights
- proper error messages
- serialized sql statements (yikes)
- minor things here and there

If it's still up, try it here: http://ec2-18-224-213-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/cs336Final/main.jsp
